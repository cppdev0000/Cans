# Cans

The start of a SameGame clone using the C# MonoGame framework. Monogame is an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework and is located at http://www.monogame.net. Monogame is a game library rather than a game framework so I have added several classes that provide the beginnings of a framework. These classes were heavily influenced by the stage/actor design pattern used in LibGDX, a Java open source game framework.

This is by no means a finished game but has a single playable level. Some of the things that are still needed are;

- Introduction
- End of level detection
- Improved graphics
- Scoreboard
- Android port would be nice to have. Monogame already supports many platforms via the mono .net framework
